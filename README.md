# My journey to become a Roboticist.

I'm starting with learning Robot Operating System(ROS) and Gazebo. I'll start by reading their own documentations first then look for better tutorials/books to learn more complex coding with these 2 softwares(if thats the correct phrase). 

Tried to run SpotMicro(https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on my own with no knowledge and failed. 
So I plan to learn these subjects before starting a project:
1. ROS2
2. Gazebo
3. Fusion 360
4. Reinforcement Learning

Watched the videos from Articulated Robotics channel and here are my notes:
